# SmoothMove

#### Don't pay big rates for small moves  

Nobody likes moving. The objective of the app is to create a better moving experience for users. If you have ever conducted a move by yourself, you will understand the pain and inefficiencies of moving solo. Often, people who are conducting moves are new to the city and may not have the network of friends to call upon for help. 

The average removalist service in inner city Melbourne is at least $200, as removalist companies often impose a minimum booking duration, even for small and short distance moves. 

SmoothMove is a platform that connects help-seekers with helpers. A help-seeker can post a listing and offer a reward in return for help. SmoothMove enables users to offer a fair price for the specific type of service they require.  

The target users for this app are people who are looking helpers in their community to assist with a move.   
A user is someone seeking help to:
- relocate
- transport a bulky item (e.g. if you have purchased/sold a second-hand piano on gumtree and don't have an appropriate transport)

A helper is someone seeking a reward by providing:
- labour (i.e. an extra pair of hands)
- transport (e.g. a van or a truck)
- supplies (e.g. boxes, tapes, tools)
